Data visualization of the NBA stats
This is a data visualization project which analyses and processes the New York Knicks shot stats from 2013.
The dataset which has been processed here is a '.csv' file using the D3.js javascript library for the front-end visual data output. 
Additional backend routing is done by Flask and Python.
